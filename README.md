## Project Description
**VolunTree** is a robust platform designed to empower Organizations in creating and managing volunteer-driven charity events with ease and efficiency. VolunTree streamlines the entire process, taking care of everything—from **Organization Registration & Management** and **Volunteer Registration & Management** to **Event Creation & Management** and **Task Assignment & Management**—all with consultation from the organizations. By partnering with VolunTree, organizations can focus entirely on their mission while we handle the logistics, supported by our comprehensive suite of tools and dedicated team to ensure every event is executed flawlessly.

## Deployment on Vercel
VolunTree is fully deployed using **Render**.

🌟 Frontend Deployment Link: https://voluntree-dzzv.onrender.com/

⚡ Backend Deployment URL: https://voluntree-backend.onrender.com 

## 📌 What is Render?
- Render is a cloud platform for deploying full-stack applications, offering:
- Serverless deployment with automatic scaling
- Fast global content delivery via an optimized CDN
- Custom domains, automatic HTTPS, and environment variables support
- Easy CLI and Git-based deployment
- Render supports various frameworks, including React, Next.js, Node.js, Python, and more, making it a popular choice for hosting web applications and backend services.


### 1️⃣ React Frontend Deployment
- ✅ The **React Application**frontend (`client/`) is deployed as a static site using **Render's static site hosting**, benefiting from automatic build optimizations.

### 2️⃣ Flask Backend Deployment

The **Flask API** backend(`server/`) is deployed on **Render** as a web service:

- ✅ **Python runtime** set to **3.12**
- ✅ **CORS enabled** for frontend-backend communication
- ✅ **gunicorn** for efficient production WSGI handling
- ✅ **Routes prefixed with** `/api/` for proper separation from frontend
